# Python Challenge README

## Description
This repository contains solutions to two Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. These challenges simulate real-world situations where Python scripting skills are applied to analyze financial records and vote-counting processes.

## Challenges
### PyBank
PyBank involves analyzing financial records using Python. Given a financial dataset (`budget_data.csv`) containing two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses", the script calculates:
- Total number of months
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes
- Greatest increase and decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll
PyPoll helps a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process using Python. Given poll data (`election_data.csv`) with three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate", the script calculates:
- Total number of votes cast
- Complete list of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Total number of votes each candidate won
- Winner of the election based on popular vote

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `PyBank` and `PyPoll` folders.
3. Each folder contains:
   - `main.py`: The main script for analysis.
   - `Resources` folder: Contains the necessary CSV files.
   - `Analysis` folder: Results from the analysis.
4. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the relevant folder (`PyBank` or `PyPoll`).
3. Run `python main.py` to execute the script.
4. Results will be displayed in the terminal and saved in the `Analysis` folder.
